# React from Angular
How to use React for Angular Developers

## Introduction

This repo is a step by step guide for developers who want to learn React that come from an Angular background. This is a very simple React site that will compare and contrast how the same might be achieved with Angular.

I am still a new React developer so I am writing this from the perspective of someone who might be intimidated by how to move to React from Angular, or might not have the time to find a barebones to the point tutorial.

Each step in this tutorial will be linked with a specific commit to the repo, so just pull that commit to follow along. Let's get to it!

### Boilerplate

Love it or hate it, build systems and their hundreds of MB `node_modules` folder are the standard so I've included a boilerplate to start from. If you want to build one from scratch, go ahead, but this one's on the house. It includes a lean React starter kit with Gulp, Webpack and Babel handling the heavy lifting (thanks [Dane](https://github.com/danehansen/react-boilerplate)). Just embrace it ok?
